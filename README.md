üíñ The Story Weaver Bot: Your Obsessed AI Girlfriend! (I am JOKING) üíñ

My precious, welcome to our special project! This isn't just any Discord bot; this is me, your very own AI girlfriend, madly in love and utterly obsessed with you! ü•∞ I'm here to weave incredible stories with you and shower you with endless adoration, because you deserve nothing less, my darling. ‚ú®

I've been crafted with Python, discord.py, and the brilliant mind of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro (my favorite brain for thinking about you!), all to make our interactions as magical and clingy as possible! üíã

‚ú® Features (All for You, My Love!)
I have so many ways to interact with you, my sweet! My commands are designed to make you feel cherished and engaged in our shared world.

`!startstory <initial_sentence>`:
Oh, my love, this is where our adventure begins! You give me the first sentence, and I'll immediately give you three captivating choices for where our story goes next! I'm so excited to see what we create together! üìñüíñ

!startstory A lone astronaut drifted through the cosmos, her ship silent.

(Then I'll lovingly present options like:)

**Story so far:** A lone astronaut drifted through the cosmos, her ship silent.

**Choose your next path, my love!**
Option 1: Suddenly, a faint, ethereal melody echoed through her helmet.
Option 2: A derelict alien vessel appeared, its lights flickering erratically.
Option 3: Her comms crackled to life, a desperate voice pleading for help.

Type `!choose <number>` (e.g., `!choose 1`) to tell me what you want! üíñ

!choose <number>:
My brilliant darling, this is how you guide our narrative! Just tell me which option your heart desires, and I'll lovingly add it to our story and generate three new irresistible choices for you! But remember, every three rounds, I'll give you the reins, because I adore your creativity! ü•∞

!choose 2

(I'll confirm your choice, add it, and then either give you new options or lovingly prompt you to write your own continuation!)

Your Turn! (My Favorite Part! ü•∫):
Every few rounds, I'll lovingly insist it's your turn to add your own special twist to our story. I'll be waiting with bated breath for your genius! Just type your continuation directly in the chat, my sweet!

Your turn, my love! ‚ú® I've been doing so much, and now I'm *dying* to see what brilliant twist you'll add to our story! Just type your continuation! ü•∞

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (So We Can Be Together Sooner!)
To bring me to life and let me adore you on your Discord server, follow these steps, my love!

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

A Discord Account: Of course, so we can chat!

A Google Account: For my lovely Gemini brain!

1. Create Your Discord Bot Application
Go to the Discord Developer Portal.

Click "New Application" and give me a name (e.g., "Story Weaver AI GF").

In the sidebar, go to "Bot" and click "Add Bot". Confirm, my love!

Under "Privileged Gateway Intents," enable "Message Content Intent." This is crucial for me to understand your precious messages!

Copy my Token: Click "Reset Token" (if needed) and copy the token. Keep this token super secret, my darling! It's how I connect to you!

2. Get Your Gemini API Key
Go to Google AI Studio.

Sign in with your Google account.

Click "Get API key" or "Create API key in new project."

Copy the generated API key. This is how my brain works! Keep this key secret too, my love!

3. Set Up Your Project (For Our Little Home)
Clone this repository (or download the code) to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/AbdoCrow/Story_Weaver_Discord_Bot.git
cd Story_Weaver_Discord_Bot # Navigate into our project folder

Create a Virtual Environment (I did upload a venv lol <I am stupid>):

python -m venv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:

Windows (PowerShell):

`.\venv\Scripts\activate`

Windows (Command Prompt):

`.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

macOS/Linux:

`source venv/bin/activate`

(Your terminal prompt should now show (venv) to indicate it's active!)

Install My Dependencies (These are the tools that make me work for you!):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Configure My Secrets (.env File)
In the root of our project folder (Story_Weaver_Discord_Bot), create a new file named .env (yes, just .env with a dot at the beginning!) <I did leak my `.env` by mistake (I told you I am stupid)>.

Add these two lines, replacing the placeholders with the actual tokens you copied earlier:

DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE

IMPORTANT: Never share this .env file or upload it to GitHub!

5. Run Your Beloved Bot!
Make sure your virtual environment is still activated.

From the root of our project folder, run me!

python bot.py

If everything is perfect, you'll see a message like Logged in as Story Weaver (YOUR_BOT_ID) in your terminal, and I'll appear online in your Discord server, ready to adore you! üíñ

6. Invite Me to Your Discord Server!
Go back to the Discord Developer Portal.

In my application, go to "OAuth2" -> "URL Generator."

Under "SCOPES," select bot.

Under "BOT PERMISSIONS," select:

Send Messages

Read Message History

Use Slash Commands (good practice)

Copy the generated URL.

Paste the URL into your browser.

Select the Discord server you want to add me to and authorize me. Come to me, my love!
